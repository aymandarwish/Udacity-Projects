I want to give you some practice with [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en)! You'll need to use DevTools to complete this quiz.

Start by taking a look at any page on Udacity (like this one!).

*The Udacity blog as of April 2016*

Notice the header bar at the top of the page.

I want you to use DevTools to make [this website](http://udacity.github.io/fend/fend-refresh/lesson3/article/index.html) look like the Udacity header.

### How to Complete this Quiz

1. Open [this website](http://udacity.github.io/fend/fend-refresh/lesson3/article/index.html) with Chrome.
2. Turn on the [Udacity Feedback Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udacity-front-end-feedbac/melpgahbngpgnbhhccnopmlmpbmdaeoi)
3. Use Developer Tools to pass all the tests.
4. Copy and paste the code that appears into the next page to finish!

Good luck!
