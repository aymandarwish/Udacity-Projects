[Slack](http://slack.com/) is a popular chat platform. (If you're enrolled in the Front End Nanodegree, then you have access to the FEND Slack team!)

A Slack channel usually shows a list of names and their messages. If you click on someone's name, you'll see a card pop up that looks something like this:

![slack profile card](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/W84T7BiILq5Lo7eZQVh51qy76nJyid64mDDJszqZkmQoWPvqFtrROProduqDW2tpvZ9hKB5oFNbWLvU6MTE=s400)

Cameron's profile card looks great, but [this one](http://udacity.github.io/fend/fend-refresh/lesson3/card/index.html) does not.

For this quiz, you'll be using Developer Tools to make [this website](http://udacity.github.io/fend/fend-refresh/lesson3/card/index.html) look more like a Slack profile card.

*Notes: the buttons at the bottom of the page have the class <code>profile-action</code>.*

You'll need to do [some](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) [research](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) for this quiz. There are at **least two new CSS properties** that you'll need to look up.
