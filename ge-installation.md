### Udacity Front End Feedback Chrome Extension

While writing code here in the Udacity classroom is a great way to learn web development, we think it's really important that you practice working with a text editor and a browser on your own computer. But we also think it's incredibly important that you get feedback on your code as you write it. So, we created the Udacity Front End Feedback Chrome Extension to give you feedback on your sites as you work on your own computer.

For the following questions and others, we expect that you'll be writing code in your text editor (doesn't matter which one) and then loading your sites in Google Chrome with this extension enabled. For some quizzes, the extension will give you a code that you'll copy and paste back into the classroom to let us know that you've finished the quiz successfully.

### How to Load the Extension

**1. Install the [Udacity Feedback Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udacity-front-end-feedbac/melpgahbngpgnbhhccnopmlmpbmdaeoi) (it's free).**

**2. Go to the Chrome extensions menu (chrome://extensions) and give the extension permission to run against file URLs.**
